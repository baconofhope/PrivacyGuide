Additional Verification: If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by cheque to an address other
than your verified credit card billing address, we may ask you to upload or send us additional information by fax (such as your driving
licence, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill, or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional
questions online to help verify your information.
