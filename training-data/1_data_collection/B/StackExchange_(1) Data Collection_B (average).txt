Users who post profiles on our Jobs site are generally doing so for the express purpose of getting connected with potential employers. So, if you post a profile on our Jobs site, and choose to make your profile visible to employers, your name (which is required) and most of the other (optional) information in your profile will be visible to employers searching for candidates. That said, your contact information (email, phone, and address) will not be provided to employers in their candidate searches. We will only allow employers to have access to your contact information in two cases, both of which are under your control:

    If you apply directly for a specific job, you will be asked to provide your name and email address (and other optional information) to the employer
    If an employer finds you through a search and wants to contact you, we will ask if you are interested in hearing from them, and if you are, we will then provide them with your contact information.
