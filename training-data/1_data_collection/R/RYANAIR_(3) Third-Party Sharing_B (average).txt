To offer you a unique and personal travel experience tailored to your preferences, we may also store information in relation to your travel behaviour, such as your favourite means of transport, travel companions, luggage and insurance options, automatic check-in, travel destinations, departure airport, ancillary products such as car and hotels, seats, duty free products, food and drinks at airports, hobbies on holidays and data roaming usage.  You may also store details of your and (with their consent) your travel companions’ travel document and your credit/debit card or other payment details. We will delete any information of a travel companion collected without the companion’s consent, as soon as we learn about it.
