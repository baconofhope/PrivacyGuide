We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, respond to a survey (e.g., Members’ salary), submit a resume and apply for or save jobs or send invitations. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list). If you sync your email or calendars with our Services, we will collect your “email header” and calendar meeting information (e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts).
